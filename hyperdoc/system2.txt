:GetKey ()

.desc
Returns an ascii code corresponding to the key last typed by the
user or 0 if all keyboard events have been reported.

The @GetKey function is useful for situations when the user is
expected to type some text.

The @KeyDown function is more apropriate when the player is 
expected to hold down certain key combinations in a more 
action oriented game environment.

.also
KeyDown;WaitKey


:WaitKey ()

.desc
Returns an ascii code corresponding to the key combination typed
by the user.

@WaitKey is similar in behavior to the @GetKey function but pauses 
program execution until a keystroke is made by the user.
